JSON is a format!
JSON always uses double-quotes to mark strings.

Say you have the following string in JavaScript.
'this is "text"'
When that gets converted into the JSON format, you will see this:
"this is \"text\""

If your quotation mark delimited string has a quotation mark in it, put a backslash before the interior quotation mark.
"Bob said, \"Well, this is interesting.\""

She woke him up with her Ramones ringtone "I Want
to be Sedated"
If you want to format that in a string in JSON format, you have to escape the quotation marks and the new lines! The above would look like this:

She woke him up with\nher Ramones ringtone \"I Want\nto be Sedated\"

JSON.stringify to create JSON-formatted strings that represent those values
JSON.parse to convert the string into a JavaScript object
