Chrome Dev Tools
Elements and Inspector
The HTML inspector can be used to figure out how your HTML is structured. You can change the value of any HTML tag attribute by double-clicking on it, or you can edit the entire element and its children by right-clicking on it and selecting Edit as HTML. Your changes will be reflected in the page immediately. You can also drag elements to reorder them or right-click and delete them. These are temporary changes.

The console is also where everything is outputted when you console.log() in your frontend code. This makes it very useful for simple debugging of your code.
